#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
RBAC ensures that users (e.g., Receptionists, Doctors, Admin) can only access features and data relevant to their roles, enhancing security and preventing unauthorized access.

#### JWT Authentication
JWT (JSON Web Tokens) is used for secure user authentication, ensuring that users' interactions with the system are authorized and their identity verified.

#### Google Authentication
Google Authentication allows users to sign in using their Google accounts, simplifying the login process and ensuring secure access without managing multiple credentials.

#### Razorpay Transaction Integration
Razorpay integration enables users to make secure payments for hospital services directly through the platform, including for appointments and medical tests.

#### Transaction Invoice Email
After each transaction, the system automatically sends an invoice to the user's email, providing a summary of the payment details.

#### Appointment Booking and Pay Later Option
Users can book appointments and choose to pay later, allowing for flexibility to complete payments at their convenience via the payment gateway.

#### Transaction Record Keeping
All transaction details, including status and amount, are securely stored, allowing users and administrators to track payment history.

#### Deployed Backend with PostgreSQL Database
The backend is powered by PostgreSQL, providing reliable, scalable, and efficient data management for hospital operations.
